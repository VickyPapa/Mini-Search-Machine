Sonnet XXXVIISonnet XXXVIIAs a decrepit father takes delightTo see his active child do deeds of youth,So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,Or any of these all, or all, or more,Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,I make my love engrafted to this store:So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,Whilst that this shadow doth such substance giveThat I in thy abundance am sufficedAnd by a part of all thy glory live.Look, what is best, that best I wish in thee:This wish I have; then ten times happy me!
