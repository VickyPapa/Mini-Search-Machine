Sonnet LXXXIIISonnet LXXXIIII never saw that you did painting needAnd therefore to your fair no painting set;I found, or thought I found, you did exceedThe barren tender of a poet's debt;And therefore have I slept in your report,That you yourself being extant well might showHow far a modern quill doth come too short,Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.This silence for my sin you did impute,Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;For I impair not beauty being mute,When others would give life and bring a tomb.There lives more life in one of your fair eyesThan both your poets can in praise devise.
