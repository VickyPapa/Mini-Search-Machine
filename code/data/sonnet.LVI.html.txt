Sonnet LVISonnet LVISweet love, renew thy force; be it not saidThy edge should blunter be than appetite,Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fillThy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,To-morrow see again, and do not killThe spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.Let this sad interim like the ocean beWhich parts the shore, where two contracted newCome daily to the banks, that, when they seeReturn of love, more blest may be the view;Else call it winter, which being full of careMakes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare.
