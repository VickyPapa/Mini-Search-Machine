Sonnet CLIIISonnet CLIIICupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:A maid of Dian's this advantage found,And his love-kindling fire did quickly steepIn a cold valley-fountain of that ground;Which borrow'd from this holy fire of LoveA dateless lively heat, still to endure,And grew a seething bath, which yet men proveAgainst strange maladies a sovereign cure.But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,But found no cure: the bath for my help liesWhere Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.
