Sonnet XLVIISonnet XLVIIBetwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,And each doth good turns now unto the other:When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,With my love's picture then my eye doth feastAnd to the painted banquet bids my heart;Another time mine eye is my heart's guestAnd in his thoughts of love doth share a part:So, either by thy picture or my love,Thyself away art resent still with me;For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,And I am still with them and they with thee;Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sightAwakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight.
