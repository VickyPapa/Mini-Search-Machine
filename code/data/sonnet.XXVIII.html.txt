Sonnet XXVIIISonnet XXVIIIHow can I then return in happy plight,That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?When day's oppression is not eased by night,But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?And each, though enemies to either's reign,Do in consent shake hands to torture me;The one by toil, the other to complainHow far I toil, still farther off from thee.I tell the day, to please them thou art brightAnd dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.But day doth daily draw my sorrows longerAnd night doth nightly make grief's strengthseem stronger.
