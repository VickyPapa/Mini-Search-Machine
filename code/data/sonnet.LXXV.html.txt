Sonnet LXXVSonnet LXXVSo are you to my thoughts as food to life,Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;And for the peace of you I hold such strifeAs 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found;Now proud as an enjoyer and anonDoubting the filching age will steal his treasure,Now counting best to be with you alone,Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;Sometime all full with feasting on your sightAnd by and by clean starved for a look;Possessing or pursuing no delight,Save what is had or must from you be took.Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,Or gluttoning on all, or all away.
