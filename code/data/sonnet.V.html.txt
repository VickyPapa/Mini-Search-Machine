Sonnet VSonnet VThose hours, that with gentle work did frameThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,Will play the tyrants to the very sameAnd that unfair which fairly doth excel:For never-resting time leads summer onTo hideous winter and confounds him there;Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:Then, were not summer's distillation left,A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
